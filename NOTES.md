# Development Notes

Those dependencies were removed from the `package.json` file, since I'm not implementing tests right now.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.14.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^12.0.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.2.1",
    "@types/jest": "^27.0.1"
  }
}
```
